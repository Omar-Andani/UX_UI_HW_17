            <h4>About Kaeja</h4>
            <p>Kaeja d’Dance is a non-profit organization that has created award-winning
                contemporary dance performances for stage, film, and communities for over 30 years. Whether
                you’re a dance enthusiast looking to get started or a seasoned veteran seeking a challenge,
                Kaeja makes dance inclusive for all.</p>

            <h4>The Problem at Hand</h4>
            <p>Through conversations with our target audience, we were able to
                determine what their expectations were when visiting a dance website. As we reviewed our
                notes, it became evident that the current Kaeja website wasn’t meeting its users’ expectations. It
                lacked a clear message as to the purpose of the organization, resulting in difficulty in users being able to 
                access key information.</p><br>
            <p>The site also lacked any sort of visual branding that one would expect when visiting a website of
                this nature; it was neither dramatic nor elegant.</p><br>
            <p>Thus, we were left wondering, how might we improve the interface and information architecture
                of the site in order to inspire dance enthusiasts to spread their passion for dance to others?</p>

            <h4>Defining the User Experience</h4>
            <p> We saw Kaeja as more than just a dance company. Their
                community involvement and mission to make dance accessible to all resonates with countless
                individuals - many of whom have no previous dance experience. Due
                to time constraints, I focused on designing a specific user journey which led to an event called
                “Porch View Dancing (PVD),” identified through our interviews as Kaeja’s most popular event.</p>
